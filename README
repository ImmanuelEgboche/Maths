# 🧠 Maths for Engineers & Creators

A lightweight repo documenting my journey through foundational maths — revisiting core concepts, translating them into code, and tying them to real-world use cases like:

- Machine learning
- Trading signals
- Encoding systems
- Graphics & simulations

## Overall Plan

| Topic | Focus | Code Examples |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Arithmetic & Fractions** | Mental models, reciprocal operations | Mixed numbers, fractional algebra |
| **Algebra** | Expressions, equations, word problems | Solving and rearranging |
| **Linear Algebra** | Vectors, matrices, transformations | Recommendation systems, graphics |
| **Sets & Logic** | Set operations, truth tables, implication | Permissions systems, feature toggles |
| **Functions** | Domain/range, composite & inverse | Mapping pipelines, function graphs |
| **Graphs** | Nodes, edges, paths | Social networks, report dependencies |
| **Probability & Statistics** | Combinatorics, averages, distributions | Coin flips, expectations, anomaly detection |

##  How This Repo Works

Each topic will aim to include:

- **Plain English problem**
- **Maths breakdown**
- **Python code implementation**

I’ll also be journalling thoughts, sticking points, and insights as I go.

##  Balance & Philosophy

This forms part of a wider commitment to growth — technical, creative, and spiritual.
